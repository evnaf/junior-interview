# Generation Esports Junior Backend Interview

Welcome to the final Generation Esports coding interview for the Junior Backend Engineer position!

This repo contains the following Tech Stack:

- Express (https://expressjs.com/)
- TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- JavaScript
- npm - The Node Package Manager (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@enriqcg/nestjs-amqp)

# Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to:

0. Clone the front-end and back-end repositories using Git and create a new branch from master on each of the repos.
1. Fix any errors with the existing code and successfully display the list of hard coded jokes on the front-end.
2. Build out another endpoint to get random joke from array.
3. Rather than having to click a button to load the jokes, change the code to load the jokes when the page loads.
4. If you have an array of jokes, what happens if you have a duplicate joke? What data structure prevents duplicate elements.
